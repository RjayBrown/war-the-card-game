<!-- CONCEPTS & GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

You can [make a contribution](#contributions) and build the next available feature on the roadmap or request a completely new feature [here](https://github.com/RjayBrown/war-the-card-game/issues/new). Any contributions you make are appreciated! You can also [fork the repo locally](https://github.com/RjayBrown/war-the-card-game#fork--run-locally) to use as a template for your own project. Making significant design or functional changes can be a great way to learn and get hands-on practice with the core concepts below.

### Core Concepts

- API's & Handling JSON Data
- Local Storage
- Promises & Asynchronous Programming
- JavaScript Syntax (ES6+)

Building this project helped me become a lot more comfortable using fetch to make API calls. Working with local storage and refactoring from promise chains to async/await was definitely a challenge at first, but I learned a lot about the improved syntax added with ES6/ES7, saving information in the browser, asynchronous programming and handling JSON data.

If you run into trouble, you can click any of the badges above to reference documentation or reach out in the [[üïí catchup-crew]](https://discord.com/channels/735923219315425401/932892279637700658) or [[‚ùìcode-help]](https://discord.com/channels/735923219315425401/735925942559440997) channels in the #100Devs Discord. It's an amazing community space filled with supportive developers happy to answer any questions you may have!

## Fork & Run Locally

**1.** To get started, open this [link](https://github.com/RjayBrown/war-the-card-game/fork) in a new tab to fork this repository

  - _**NOTE:** You may find it easier to keep the same name, but you can change it if you like!_

**2.** Click the code button to open the dropdown and copy the URL **(make sure HTTPS is selected)**.

**3.** Open the terminal in your editor, type 'git clone' and paste the URL **(the command should follow one of the formats below)**.

  ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/war-the-card-game
  ```
  ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME
  ```

**4.** Run the command **(Press Enter)**

**5.** Navigate to the project folder

   ```
   cd war-the-card-game
   ```
   ```
   cd YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME
   ```

**Done!** You are now able to make changes or completely rebuild the project. Happy coding!
