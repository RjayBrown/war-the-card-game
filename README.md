<!-- CONCEPTS & GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

You can [make a contribution](#contributions) and build a feature from the roadmap or send a request to add a completely new feature. Any contributions you make are appreciated! You can also clone the repo locally to use as a template for your own project. Making significant design or functional changes can be a great way to learn and get hands-on practice with the core concepts below.

### Core Concepts

- API's & Handling JSON Data
- Promises & Asynchronous Programming
- JavaScript ES6+ (try/catch & async/await)

Building this project helped me become much more comfortable working with client-side fetch in JavaScript. Refactoring from promise chains to async/await was definitely a challenge at first, but I learned a lot about how promises work and using asynchronous programming features from ES6/ES7 to handle JSON data.

If you run into trouble, you can click any of the badges above to reference documentation or reach out in the #100Devs [[❓code-help]](https://discord.com/channels/735923219315425401/735925942559440997) channel on Discord. It's an amazing community space filled with supportive developers happy to answer any questions you may have!

### 1. Clone Locally

- Open the terminal in your code editor and type (or copy/paste):

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/RjayBrown/war-the-card-game
  ```

  - _**NOTE:** You can also click the green code button and copy the url (make sure HTTPS is selected)_

- Navigate to the project folder

      ```
      cd war-the-card-game
      ```

  You are now able to access the project locally.
